        Many people assume that JavaScript is essential for building anything
        dynamic. But what if you challenged yourself to rely solely on HTML and
        CSS? That’s exactly what I did — and I was surprised at how much is
        possible.
        <br /><br />
        I used creative CSS properties like `scroll-behavior`, `:target`,
        `:checked`, and `@keyframes` to replicate behaviors usually reserved for
        JavaScript. For example, my "Back to Top" button bounces with pure CSS
        animation, and modal-like behavior can be mimicked using hidden checkbox
        hacks.
        <br /><br />
        I even created responsive menus, sliders, and hover effects — all
        without a single line of JS. It forced me to think more deeply about the
        browser’s capabilities and improved my understanding of HTML semantics
        and CSS specificity.
        <br /><br />
        So yes — it’s absolutely possible to build creative, accessible, and
        beautiful websites without JavaScript. It’s not about limitations — it’s
        about mastering your tools.
