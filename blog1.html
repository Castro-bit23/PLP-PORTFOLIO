      <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8">
        Designing this portfolio was a challenge I embraced with just HTML and
        CSS. I began by mapping the key sections like Hero, Skills, Projects,
        Blog, Testimonials, and Contact...
        <br /><br />
        I applied `flexbox` and `grid` to achieve responsiveness without any
        JavaScript. Transitions, hover effects, and media queries ensured a
        smooth UI on mobile and desktop. The back-to-top button is pure CSS
        magic with `:target` selectors and `keyframes` for bounce effects.
        <br /><br />
        Styling was enhanced with a dark color palette, HSL hues, and subtle
        shadows. The entire site demonstrates how powerful HTML and CSS alone
        can be when thoughtfully applied.
