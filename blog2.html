      <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8">
        This year has been a huge leap in my development journey. I’ve designed,
        coded, and deployed some of my most meaningful and challenging projects
        yet. Here are my top three:
        <br /><br />
        <strong>1. MyAfya Hub Clone</strong><br />
        A clean, responsive web version of the MyAfya Hub app, featuring static
        screens, mock dashboards, and mobile-first design. I recreated complex
        UI interactions using only CSS animations and layout tricks.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>2. Portfolio Version 3.0</strong><br />
        This very portfolio site! It’s my best iteration so far — responsive,
        lightweight, and JavaScript-free. It includes a blog, testimonials
        carousel, contact form, and dynamic UI elements — all with HTML and CSS.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>3. CSS-Only Image Gallery</strong><br />
        A creative project where I built a responsive, filterable gallery using
        no JavaScript. With `:checked` toggles, pure CSS grid, and transitions,
        I proved what CSS can do on its own.
        <br /><br />
        These projects pushed me technically and creatively — and they continue
        to inspire my future builds.
